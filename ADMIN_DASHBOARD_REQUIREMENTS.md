# Requirements for Admin Dashboard to Override User Preferences

1. **Centralized Preference Management**

   - Create a server-side admin interface to manage user preference records stored in the database.
   - Provide CRUD operations for admins to modify individual or global user settings (e.g., theme, telemetry).
   - Ensure preference values cascade: admin overrides > user-specific settings > defaults.

2. **API and Authentication**

   - Expose REST or RPC endpoints for updating preferences; secure them with admin-only authentication.
   - Leverage existing auth integration in docs (e.g., use the environment variables and authentication mechanisms described for server setup)

3. **UI Implementation**

   - Build a dashboard page in the admin area with forms and tables to view/edit preferences.
   - Use existing component libraries (Ant Design and lobe-ui) as per the projectâ€™s tech stack

4. **Data Model**

   - Extend the database schema to store admin overrides in a separate table or within existing user records.
   - Ensure consistency with the postgres/pglite setup explained in the development guide

5. **Propagation**
   - Update Zustand slices (e.g., `src/store/user/slices/preference`) to fetch admin overrides at login or periodically.
   - Merge overrides with current user preference state before rendering UI.
